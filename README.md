# Lab 6: Working with GitHub and JavaScript Classes

Throughout this lab, I focused on enhancing my understanding of GitHub and JavaScript classes. Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

## Overview

The lab was designed to provide practical experience in using GitHub for version control and implementing JavaScript classes to manage a collection of books.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Joining GitHub and Completing the Introduction to GitHub Course:** I signed up for GitHub and completed the Introduction to GitHub course to gain a solid understanding of version control and repository management.
- **Creating a Lab File:** I created a new file for my lab work where I implemented and tested JavaScript classes.
- **Gaining an Overview of JavaScript Classes:** I reviewed the concept of JavaScript classes, including properties, methods, and constructors.
- **Creating and Testing Book Class:** I defined a `Book` class with properties like title, author, and ISBN, and implemented methods to manage book data. I also wrote tests to ensure the `Book` class functions correctly.
- **Creating and Testing Library Class:** I defined a `Library` class to manage a collection of `Book` objects, implemented methods to add and retrieve books, and tested the `Library` class functionality.
- **Adding More Books to the Library:** I instantiated and added at least two more `Book` objects to the `Library` class, simulating a collection of books.
- **Adding ISBN and Implementing Delete Book Method:** I enhanced the `Book` class to include an ISBN property and implemented a method in the `Library` class to delete a book using its ISBN. I thoroughly tested the new functionality to ensure accurate deletion of books.

## Lab Structure

Throughout the lab, I followed a structured series of steps that allowed me to:
- Sign up for GitHub and complete the Introduction to GitHub course.
- Create a dedicated lab file for my project work.
- Understand the basics of JavaScript classes and constructors.
- Create and test the `Book` class to manage individual books.
- Create and test the `Library` class to manage a collection of books.
- Expand the library by adding more books and implementing advanced functionality like deleting books.

By completing this lab, I gained valuable hands-on experience in using GitHub for version control and managing JavaScript classes effectively to create and manipulate objects.
