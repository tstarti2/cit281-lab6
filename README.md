# Lab 6: Working with GitHub and JavaScript Classes

## Overview

This lab is designed to enhance your understanding of GitHub and JavaScript classes. You will start by familiarizing yourself with GitHub, then proceed to create and test JavaScript classes, and finally, manage a collection of books using these classes.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Join GitHub and complete the Introduction to GitHub course**
- **Create a lab file for this project**
- **Gain an overview of JavaScript classes**
- **Create and test a Book class**
- **Create and test a Library class**
- **Add at least two more books to the library**
- **Add ISBN to books and implement a method to delete a book**

## Lab Structure

### Part 1: Join GitHub and Work Through Introduction to GitHub Course

- Sign up for GitHub and complete the Introduction to GitHub course to understand the basics of version control and repository management.

### Part 2: Create Lab File

- Create a new file for your lab work where you will implement and test your JavaScript classes.

### Part 3: Classes Overview

- Review the concept of JavaScript classes, including properties, methods, and the use of constructors.

### Part 4: Create and Test Book Class

- Define a `Book` class with properties like title, author, and ISBN. Implement methods to manage book data.
- Write tests to ensure the `Book` class functions correctly.

### Part 5: Create and Test Library Class

- Define a `Library` class that manages a collection of `Book` objects. Implement methods to add and retrieve books.
- Write tests to ensure the `Library` class functions correctly.

### Part 6: Add at Least Two More Books to the Library

- Instantiate and add at least two more `Book` objects to the `Library` class to simulate a collection of books.

### Part 7: Add ISBN and a Delete Book Method

- Enhance the `Book` class to include an ISBN property.
- Implement a method in the `Library` class to delete a book using its ISBN.
- Test the new functionality to ensure books can be deleted accurately.

By completing this lab, you will gain practical experience in using GitHub for version control and managing JavaScript classes to create and manipulate objects effectively.
